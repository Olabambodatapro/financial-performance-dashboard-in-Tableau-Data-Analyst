# Financial-performance-dashboard-in-Tableau-Data-Analyst
In this project I built a financial performance dashboard in Tableau. Using Excel as a source for data preparation, and used Tableauâ€™s visual tools to display KPIs such as ROI, profit margins, and expenses.
Title: Financial KPI Analysis (2020-2024)

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key financial metrics, including revenue, cost, profit, gross vs. operating margin, ROI, and investment distribution, for the years 2020 through 2024.
The insights from this analysis help to evaluate the company's financial health and guide decision-making to improve performance.

Key Insights:
- The chart shows how investments were allocated, with the highest in 2021.
